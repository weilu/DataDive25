 SECTION 1: Public vs Private Sector Employment

  Title: "Who Employs the Workforce?"

  Main Narrative:
  "In [Country], the public sector accounts for [X]% of total formal employment as of [Year], meaning approximately 1 in [ratio] formally employed workers work for the
  government. Between [Start Year] and [End Year], the public sector's share has [increased/decreased] from [X]% to [Y]%, reflecting [Z]% growth. During this period, for every
  worker employed in the public sector, there were approximately [ratio] workers in the private formal sector."

  Gender Dimension (short paragraph):
  "Women represent [X]% of public sector employment compared to [Y]% in the private sector, a [Z] percentage point gap suggesting that public sector jobs are more accessible to
  women."

  SECTION 2: Public Sector Wage Premium

  Title: "Is Public Sector Work Better Paid?"

  Main Narrative:
  "Public sector workers in [Country] earn, on average, [X]% more than comparable private sector workers as of [Year]. This premium has [increased/decreased] from [Y]% in [Start
  Year], suggesting that public sector wages have grown [faster/slower] than private sector wages. The premium varies significantly across sectors: education workers enjoy a
  premium of [X]%, while health workers see [Y]%."

  Gender Wage Premium:
  "Female workers in the public sector experience a wage premium of [X]% compared to private sector female workers, while male workers see a premium of [Y]%. This [Z] percentage
  point difference suggests that public sector employment provides relatively better compensation for women, potentially contributing to gender equity in earnings. Between [Start
   Year] and [End Year], the female wage premium has [increased/decreased] from [A]% to [B]%, indicating that public employment is becoming [more/less] advantageous for women."

  SECTION 3: Public Employment Composition & Wage Bill

  Title: "Where Are Public Workers Employed and What Does Government Spend on Wages?"

  Part A: Wage Bill Composition (BOOST COFOG functional breakdown)

  "Government wage bill spending in [Year] was concentrated in three functional areas: [COFOG Category 1] consumed [X]% of total wage bill ([amount]), followed by [COFOG Category
   2] at [Y]% ([amount]), and [COFOG Category 3] at [Z]% ([amount]). Together, these three areas accounted for [sum]% of all government spending on public sector wages."

  Part B: Linking Employment to Wage Spending (where WWBI data matches COFOG)

  "For education, which represents [X]% of public employees, wage spending totaled [amount], accounting for [Y]% of total government expenditure and [Z]% of total education
  spending. This means that for every 100 Lek spent on education, [Z] Lek goes to teacher and staff salaries. Similarly, health workers comprise [A]% of public employment, with
  health wage spending at [amount], representing [B]% of total government expenditure and [C]% of total health spending."

  Part C: Overall Fiscal Burden & Trends

  "Total government spending on public sector wages was [amount] in [Year], representing [X]% of GDP and [Y]% of total government expenditure, making it the
  [largest/second-largest] spending category in the budget. When adjusted for inflation, wage bill spending has [increased/decreased] by [Z]% between [Start Year] and [End Year],
   [outpacing/lagging] the [A]% growth in the number of public employees."

  SECTION 4: Gender in Public Employment

  Title: "How Are Women Represented in Public Jobs?"

  Overall Representation:
  "Women comprise [X]% of all public sector employment in [Country], compared to [Y]% in private sector formal employment. This representation has [increased/decreased] from [Z]%
   in [Start Year], reflecting [positive/negative] trends in gender equality."

  Sectoral Variation:
  "Gender representation varies significantly across sectors: women represent [X]% of education workers and [Y]% of health workers, but only [Z]% of public safety workers and
  [A]% of core administration workers. This distribution reflects both traditional gender roles and evolving opportunities."

  Occupational Glass Ceiling:
  "While women hold [X]% of professional positions in the public sector, they occupy only [Y]% of managerial positions. This [Z] percentage point gap indicates a 'glass ceiling'
  effect where women are well-represented in mid-level roles but underrepresented in leadership. Between [Start Year] and [End Year], female representation in management has
  [improved/declined] from [A]% to [B]%."

  Summary: Complete Narrative Flow (One Sample Country)

  Section 1 (Public vs Private)

  "In Albania, the public sector accounts for 25% of total formal employment as of 2020, meaning approximately 1 in 4 formally employed workers work for the government. Between
  2015 and 2020, the public sector's share has decreased from 27% to 25%, while total formal employment grew by 15%. For every worker employed in the public sector, there were
  approximately 3 workers in the private formal sector. Women represent 52% of public sector employment compared to 43% in the private sector, a 9 percentage point gap suggesting
   that public sector jobs are more accessible to women."

  Section 2 (Wage Premium)

  "Public sector workers in Albania earn, on average, 15% more than comparable private sector workers as of 2020. This premium has increased from 12% in 2015, suggesting that
  public sector wages have grown faster than private sector wages. The premium varies significantly across sectors: education workers enjoy a premium of 22%, while health workers
   see 19%. Female workers in the public sector experience a wage premium of 19% compared to private sector female workers, while male workers see a premium of 12%. This 7
  percentage point difference suggests that public sector employment provides relatively better compensation for women."

  Section 3 (Composition & Wage Bill)

  "Government wage bill spending in 2020 was concentrated in three functional areas: education consumed 40% of total wage bill (37.7 billion Lek), followed by general public
  services at 26% (24.5 billion Lek), and health at 16% (15.1 billion Lek). Together, these three areas accounted for 82% of all government spending on public sector wages."

  "For education, which represents 42% of public employees according to labor surveys, wage spending totaled 37.7 billion Lek, accounting for 15% of total government expenditure
  and 78% of total education spending. This means that for every 100 Lek spent on education, 78 Lek goes to teacher and staff salaries. Similarly, health workers comprise 15% of
  public employment, with health wage spending at 15.1 billion Lek, representing 6% of total government expenditure and 72% of total health spending."

  "Total government spending on public sector wages was 94.2 billion Lek in 2020, representing 7.5% of GDP and 35% of total government expenditure, making it the largest spending
   category in the budget. When adjusted for inflation, wage bill spending has increased by 18% between 2015 and 2020, outpacing the 6% growth in the number of public employees."


  Section 4 (Gender)

  "Women comprise 52% of all public sector employment in Albania, compared to 43% in private sector formal employment. This representation has increased from 50% in 2015,
  reflecting positive trends in gender equality. Gender representation varies significantly across sectors: women represent 68% of education workers and 62% of health workers,
  but only 18% of public safety workers and 52% of core administration workers. While women hold 58% of professional positions in the public sector, they occupy only 32% of
  managerial positions. This 26 percentage point gap indicates a 'glass ceiling' effect. Between 2015 and 2020, female representation in management has improved from 28% to 32%."
