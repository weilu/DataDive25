# Challenge 4: Women in Public Sector Jobs: Crowding Out or In?

## 🎯 The Core Question
**Does the public sector act as a "magnet" that drains female talent from the private sector, or a "catalyst" that normalizes female employment and spurs private sector growth?**

We aim to assess whether women’s high public-sector employment reduces private-sector opportunities (via queuing, wage expectations, talent diversion) or expands them (via norm shifts, spillovers).

## ⚖️ Hypotheses to Test

### Hypothesis A: The "Crowding Out" Effect (Negative)
*   **Mechanism**: High public sector wages and stability raise women's "reservation wages" (the minimum wage they will accept).
*   **Observable Outcome**: Skilled women "queue" for government jobs rather than entering the private sector.
*   **Metric**: High correlation between *Public Sector Share* and *Female Unemployment* or *Hiring Difficulty* in private firms.

### Hypothesis B: The "Crowding In" / Spillover Effect (Positive)
*   **Mechanism**: Visible women in public leadership shift social norms and reduce gender discrimination.
*   **Observable Outcome**: Higher public sector participation leads to *increased* overall female labor force participation over time.
*   **Metric**: Positive correlation between *Public Sector Share* and *Private Sector Female Employment* (lagged).

## 📊 Data Strategy

| Data Source | Key Metrics to Extract | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WB Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators** | Public-sector employment shares by gender, wage premiums. | Define the "Pull" factor of the public sector. |
| **WB Global Labor Database** | Female FLFP, unemployment duration, reservation wages. | Measure Labor Supply behavior. |
| **WB Enterprise Surveys (WBES)** | Skills constraints, hiring difficulty, unfilled vacancies. | Measure Private Sector Demand constraints. |
| **ILO Labor Force Stats** | Sectoral employment breakdown. | General labor market context. |

## 🚀 Analytical Approach
1.  **Quantify the Public Premium**: Calculate the wage/stability gap between public and private sectors for women.
2.  **Correlation Analysis**: Test if regions with higher "Public Premium" have higher "Private Sector Skills Shortages".
3.  **Cluster Analysis**: Group countries into "Crowd-out" vs "Crowd-in" clusters based on the data.
